API for audioBLAST!

## Extending functionality
The API functionality is expanded through a modular interface, exploring the [modules](https://github.com/audioblast/api.audioblast.org/tree/master/modules) directory will provide an overview of how these modules are written. Modules that expand functionality by providiging new analyses are likely to require the creation of new database tables, and this will require one of the admin team to assit (please raise a new GitHub issue).

Modules that solely provide new data sources may be submitted as unsolicited pull requests.
